							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>The poem Andrii Popa, written by Vasile Alecsandri in 1843, is reminiscent of an outlaw who for 7 years has
								roamed the country without being able to be caught. In 1818, Mihai Cozoni, the author's uncle, received a princely command
								to catch the thief and managed to kill him from the horse's run to Valea Seacă. Although the lyrics originally wanted to put
								in light of his uncle's valiant deeds, the modern interpretation made him a hero even the outlaw.
								"Who passes into the Valley-Seaca / With the hamger without the sheath / And with the chest unveiled? / Andrii-Popa the famous!"
								The poem became famous after the band Phoenix put the lyrics on music (by Mircea Baniciu) and was
								focused only on the character of Andrii Popa, without remembering the one who captured him. Due to success
								of that song, several localities Valea Seacă wanted to award the famous outlaw. Thus, some voices
								say that Andrii Popa would have been from Oltenia area, and others say that it must have been from the Area of Moldova, because
								from here were Vasile Alecsandri and his uncle. The closest Seaca Valley to his native place
								Alecsandri is this very commune north of Pascani, which is why this Inn appeared here
								Andrii Popa.
								However, the most plausible from a historical point of view is that Valea Seacă from Alecsandri's poetry makes
								a reference to Valea Seacă in Bacău, as the poem was written while he was in Târgu Ocna.</p>
